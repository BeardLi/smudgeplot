I have troubles understanding my smudgeplot. I have used follwing command to generate it

```
smudgeplot plot kmer_pairs_coverages_2.tsv -o my_org -t "Figure 1a: genome structure of X. odoratum" -L 40 -k 19
```

and it look like this:

(add smudgeplot)

Now, I (know/have indication) already of (genome size/number of chromosomes/ploidy/...) from (RADseq/flow cytometry/karyotypes/inSitu/...) data. This does not make sense together with the smudge because (it predicts unexpected ploidy/shows only one smudge/...).

How should I understand my smudgeplot?
